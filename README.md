## Game

The player can move using the arrow keys on the keyboard. 
You may not move the player out of the map's bounds.

To score, the player must reach the water on the other side of the rocks. 
Bugs will spawn in the middle with varying speeds, lanes, and times. 
If the player touches the bug, he respawns at the bottom. 

Good luck!
